# Comprehensive SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning & NLP

This project provides a thorough comparative analysis of various machine learning models and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for SMS spam detection. It evaluates the performance of classic and gradient-boosted models when combined with different text vectorization methods, from simple Bag-of-Words to advanced BERT embeddings.

## üìñ Overview

The goal of this project is to identify the most effective combination of machine learning models and text representation techniques for classifying SMS messages as "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The code systematically trains and evaluates four different classification models on feature sets generated by six distinct NLP vectorization techniques. It also addresses the common issue of class imbalance in spam datasets by using the **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Multiple Model Support**: Implements **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **XGBoost**, and **LightGBM** for a comprehensive comparison.
  * **Diverse NLP Techniques**: Utilizes a wide range of text vectorization methods:
      * **Bag-of-Words (BOW)**
      * **TF-IDF**
      * **Word2Vec** (CBOW)
      * **GloVe** (Pre-trained embeddings)
      * **Doc2Vec**
      * **BERT** (Pre-trained transformer model)
  * **Standardized Preprocessing**: Includes a robust text preprocessing pipeline to clean and normalize raw SMS data for each technique.
  * **Class Imbalance Handling**: Integrates **SMOTE** to create a balanced training dataset, preventing model bias towards the majority class.
  * **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates each model-technique combination using four key metrics: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.
  * **Automated Visualization**: Automatically generates bar charts for each experiment, making it easy to visualize and compare performance metrics.

## üåü Advantages

  * **Comprehensive Analysis**: Instead of relying on a single approach, this framework provides a side-by-side comparison, offering deep insights into which methods work best for this specific task.
  * **Educational Value**: Serves as an excellent learning resource for understanding the practical impact of different text embedding strategies on model performance.
  * **Reproducibility**: The code is well-structured and includes all necessary setup steps, allowing others to easily reproduce the experiments and results.
  * **Modularity**: The code is organized in a way that makes it simple to extend the project by adding new machine learning models or NLP techniques.

## üöÄ Applications

The methodologies and code in this repository can be adapted for various real-world applications, including:

  * **Spam Filtering**: For email clients, messaging apps, and communication platforms.
  * **Phishing Detection**: Identifying malicious messages designed to steal sensitive information.
  * **Content Moderation**: Automatically filtering out spam or inappropriate comments on social media and forums.
  * **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying text based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) with minor modifications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  * **Python 3**
  * **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`
  * **NLP & Embeddings**: `nltk`, `gensim`, `transformers` (Hugging Face)
  * **Data Handling**: `pandas`, `numpy`
  * **Class Imbalance**: `imbalanced-learn`
  * **Deep Learning**: `torch` (for BERT)
  * **Data Visualization**: `matplotlib`
  * **Dataset Management**: `kagglehub`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * A Kaggle account is required to download the dataset.
  * You must have your Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) configured. You can do this by running `kagglehub.login()` in a notebook cell and following the instructions.

### 2\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

The provided code includes cells for installing all necessary libraries. It is recommended to create a virtual environment first.

```bash
!pip install pandas==2.2.3 numpy==1.26.4 scipy==1.13.1 scikit-learn==1.2.2 imbalanced-learn==0.12.3 nltk==3.9.1 gensim==4.3.3 transformers==4.52.4 torch==2.6.0 xgboost==2.0.3 lightgbm==4.5.0 matplotlib==3.7.2 kagglehub
```

*Note: The versions are specified to ensure compatibility as per the original notebook.*

### 4\. Run the Code

The project is structured as a series of Python script blocks (or notebook cells).

1.  **Run the Setup Cell**: The first block handles the import of Kaggle data sources (`sms-spam-collection-dataset` and `glove-6b-100d`) and installs dependencies.
2.  **Execute Model Blocks**: Run each subsequent block to train and evaluate the models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and SVM) with all NLP techniques. Each block is self-contained.

## üìä Results

After running the code, the output for each model block will include:

1.  **Performance Metrics Table**: A pandas DataFrame summarizing the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for the model across all six NLP techniques.
2.  **Bar Charts**: A series of plots, one for each technique, visualizing the performance metrics.

This allows for a clear comparison, where you will likely observe that advanced, context-aware embeddings like **BERT** often yield the highest performance, while traditional methods like **TF-IDF** provide a strong, computationally cheaper baseline.
